# Lets Learn Web-Scraping with Python

I had no idea how or where to start. So, I started finding tutorials on Youtube and i found this one.

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b3j1uNcF6E">Web Scraping with Python</a>

### So, What is Web Scraping?

web scraping is the process of extracting data from a website.

thats it. Simple...

### BUT HOW!!

### How to do Web Scraping?

there are several ways to do it.

1. Beautiful Soup
2. Selenium
3. Scrapy

#### The easiest would be <i>Beautiful Soup</i>.

# !!!-- lets start --!!!

## Installation

- pip install beautifulsoup4

Install the module from the command line.

You can use any code editor to write your code. Im using Vs Code.

So, Start by making a new file.

I named my file <code>web_scraping.py</code>

- first we need to import the module.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

Now, we need a website to scrape. so, i will make a simple dummy html page.

i'll name it <code>dummy.html</code>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Dummy HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Dummy HTML Page</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <h2>List of Fruits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Orange</li>
      <li>Banana</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Table of Users</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>John</td>
        <td>25</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jane</td>
        <td>30</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div>
      <h4>Important Message</h4>
      <p>This is an important message within a div element.</p>
    </div>

    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2022 Dummy HTML Page. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

as you can see its a small html page with some nested tags and some different type of html elements.

now to scrape this page we need to open the file with python and read it.

```python
with open('dummy.html', 'r') as f:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(f, 'html.parser')
```

Now we break it down step by step:

- `with open('dummy.html', 'r') as f:` opens the dummy.html file, with the 'r' mode, meaning we can only read the file but not write to it.

- `soup = BeautifulSoup(f, 'html.parser')` creates a variable called <code>soup</code> and assigns it to the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> class, in which the file <code>dummy.html</code> is passed as an argument.

- and dont forget to indent after `with open('dummy.html', 'r') as f:`

Now if we do `print(soup)` you will see some gibberish. That is not readable. SO, to make it more readable we need to use the <code>prettify()</code> method.

```python
print(soup.prettify())
```

Now, after running the python file, you get something similler to the dummy html page.

## Finding a tag

### "." Operator

In general, the simplest way to find a tag would be to use the <code>"."</code> operator.

```python
print(soup.h1)
```

Here we are instructing python to print the <code>h1</code> tag from the <code>soup</code> variable.

run the code and you will see whats inside the first <code>h1</code> tag.

you can also try,
```python
print(soup.title)
```
But there is an issue. In the output you might see Something like this:

> `<title>Dummy HTML Page</title>`

We need the data inside the tag not the tag itself. So, we need to use the <code>"."</code> operator again.

```python
print(soup.title.string)
```

Now you will see the data inside the tag.

> `Dummy HTML Page`

Here, <code>soup.title<code>.string</code></code> is used which returns the data inside the tag.

You can also change whats inside the tag.

just add these lines of code.

```python 
soup.title.string = 'New Title'
print(soup.prettify())
```

> Now if you look for the title tag again, you will see the new title.


### Find() & Find_all()

Before starting we should clean up the code and keep these part.

```python
# importing beautifulsoup4
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# opening the html file
with open("dummy.html", "r") as f:
    # parsing the html file
    soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")
```

> So, find() and find_all() are used to find a tag.But find() returns only the first tag and find_all() returns all the tags.

```python
print(soup.find("h1"))
print(soup.find_all("h1"))
```
